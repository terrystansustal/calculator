# Overview

[Software Demo Video](https://youtu.be/KL9BxvQ42s0)

As a software engineer, I decided to make a calculator program that can assist students with their studies in mathematics. I developed this software using the C++ language.
This software performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In addition, it allows the user to view the history of their calculations
and it gives them an option to save it in a file for future reference.

# Development Environment

The tools that I used to develop the software is Visual Studio Code, C++, and C++ Extension Pack

# Future Work

- Allow the user to add more calculations to a previosuly saved file
- Allow the user to make an additional saved file instead of overriding the previous saved file
- Add complicated mathematical operations
